# Manager README

## Motivation for this document 
Hi, This is meant to be a README file that is aimed at introducing you to my management style & philosophy. This document is meant to help you understand me better and hopefully enables us to work better together, but is definitely not meant as a replacement to actually getting to know each other.

### TL;DR
1. Your wellbeing in the company is my most important KPI. If you want to talk to me, you should interrupt whatever I'm doing and we can talk. We don't need to wait for our next 1:1. 
2. However, the same rule does not apply for technical questions. If you interrupt me, I expect you to have tried to solve the problem on your own (or google it) first.

## My role
### In a nutshell
1. Retain & grow our talent
2. Project Management (Including agreeing with you that the assigned ticket is specified to your liking & Ready For Development)
3. Hire new talent (because hiring never stops)
4. Technical discussions - always available to discuss efficient ways of solving a problem

If I find myself with free time in-between those three points, I switch back to Developer mode; usually in collaboration with other developers in-between tasks. 

## My Assumptions
1. You will let me know if you're unable to do your job 
2. You feel safe debating with me 
3. You know what you're doing better than I do
4. You know the codebase you're working on better than me; However if you tell me that a problem can't be solved a certain way, I will keep probing you until you convince me. It's only at this point that we can  begin debating an alternate solution

## My Expectations
Your work. This is what I usually track:
1. Your communication with Product/Design as you work through your epic
2. Overcoming a problem - either my splitting a task into subtasks, finding a new library online, asking a teammate for help etc.
3. Driving your work to production - Because you understand that merging to master does not mean that the job is done
4. Ownership of your stories - How you deal with QA and bugs that may arise from tickets that you have worked on

## Transparency
Our conversations are always private, unless you do require me to involve someone else in the discussion
Sometimes the company can require me to keep something secret, but they will never ask me to lie to you

## How you can help me

1. Make good use of our 1:1s; Give me feedback about:
    1. my managerial style - Tell me when I screw up
    2. The team
    3. The problems that you're solving
    4. The company vision 
    5. Yourself 
2. Do great work 
3. Be reflective & share them with me
    1. Are you happy doing the same kind of work you're doing for the next year?
    2. What do you want to learn?
    3. What are your ambitions? - For yourself, for the company, for a problem etc.
    4. Tell me when I screw up 

## Personality quirks 
1. I can sometimes make impulsive decisions based on gut feeling, if you feel like the decision is too hasty you should call me out on it.
2. I enjoy optimising a solution. Even if I can save just 50 milliseconds, I get a kick out of it. If you have a solution, I want to hear it. If I take it too far, you should call me out on it.
3. I want to learn from you, and I want you to teach me. I am probably mediocre at best at what you're currently working on. 


This is a living, breathing document. If my expectations are unfair or if I fail to live up to my responsibilities that I have listed in this document, you should call me out on it
